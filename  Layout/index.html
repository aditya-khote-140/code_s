All of the features that are visible to the client, or the viewer of the site, are included in the front end.<br><br> Programming a browser (By using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)<br><br> Programming a server (By using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)<br><br> Let’s say you’re using your Instagram application. Every time you refresh, new content is loaded on your screen. You can like a picture, add new ones, search for profiles and do so much more. Although it provides a seamless user experience, there’s a lot that goes on in the backend. HTTP requests are made to the Instagram servers to retrieve and load information. This is facilitated with the help of backend frameworks. <br><br> Typically every application consists of the front-end, the backend, and the database. <br><br> A Full Stack Developer is associated with the creation of an application from its start to finish. He designs the front-end and the backend of an application while ensuring its efficiency, reliability, and other crucial features. </p><br> </td>
